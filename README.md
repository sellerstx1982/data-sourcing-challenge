# Data Sourcing Challenge
My coding project uses the Pandas Library of Python in Jupyter Notebook to access API data from the New York Times and The Movie Database to retrieve, clean, and merge data.

## Process:
To begin, you will need to sign up for an API key from the New York Times and The Movie Database. Once an API key is received and placed in an env file named .env, calling them NYT_API_KEY and TMDB_API_KEY. Next you will download the retrieve_movie_data.ipynb file, and save it in the same folder as your .env file. Then open the retrieve_movie_data.ipynb file in a source code editor that supports Jupyter Notebook. Each cell has code that displays an output below the individual cell. Use the play button outside the top left corner of each cell to run each cell. You can also click inside the cell and press Shift + Enter to run the cell and move down to the next cell. The output of each cell displays what the comment requests and uses the Pandas Library of the Python coding language.
